/**
 * Sent to a portlet to update some of its properties. The interpretation
 * of the properties is completely dependent on the handling portlet.
 * 
 * This event has a close relationship to the {@link NotifyPortletModel}
 * event. The latter is used by portlet's functions to send information
 * from the portal page to the portlet model. It passes the information 
 * as a {@link JsonArray}. The interpretation of this information is only 
 * known by the portlet. The {@link UpdatePortletModel} event should be 
 * used to to pass information within the application, i.e. on the server
 * side.
 * 
 * Depending on the information passed, it may be good practice to 
 * write an event handler for the portlet that converts a 
 * {@link NotifyPortletModel} to a {@link UpdatePortletModel} that is
 * fired on its channel instead of handling it immediately. This allows 
 * events sent from the portal page and from other components in the 
 * application to be handled in a uniform way.
